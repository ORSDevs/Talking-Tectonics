            <h2>What are Plate Tectonics?</h2>
            <p>Tectonic plates are massive, rigid pieces of the Earth's lithosphere, which is the outermost shell of the Earth, called the Earthâ€™s crust. The lithosphere is broken into several large and small pieces known as tectonic plates. There are 8 major plates, 14 minor plates, and around 57 micro plates. These plates are like giant puzzle pieces that fit together to form the Earth's surface. Plate tectonics are the reason our earth looks the way it does. </p>

            <ul>
                <h3>Lithosphere and Asthenosphere:</h3>
                <li>The Earth's lithosphere is relatively cool and rigid, consisting of the crust and the upper part of the mantle.</li>
                <li>Beneath the lithosphere lies the asthenosphere, which is partially molten and flows more easily than the rigid lithosphere.</li>

                <h3>Tectonic Plates:</h3>
                <li>The lithosphere is divided into several tectonic plates, which can vary in size from a few kilometers to thousands of kilometers across.</li>
                <li>There are eight major plates, such as the North American Plate, South American Plate, Eurasian Plate, African Plate, Antarctic Plate, Indo-Australian Plate, Nazca Plate, and Pacific Plate, as well as many smaller plates.</li>
                
                <p><h3>Plate Boundaries:</h3></p>
                <li>Tectonic plates are in constant motion, although they move very slowly. The movement is driven by forces like mantle convection, where hot material rises and cooler material sinks.</li>
                <li>The interactions between these plates occur at boundaries. There are three main types of plate boundaries:</li>
                <li><strong>Divergent Boundaries:</strong> Plates move away from each other. Magma rises from below the Earth's surface, creating new crust as it solidifies.</li>
                <li><strong>Convergent Boundaries:</strong> Plates move towards each other. One plate may be forced beneath another in a process known as subduction, and this can lead to the formation of mountain ranges or deep ocean trenches.</li>
                <li><strong>Transform Boundaries:</strong> Plates slide past each other horizontally. The movement can cause earthquakes along faults.</li>

                <p><h3>Plate Interactions:</h3></p>
                <li>These interactions at plate boundaries cause various geological phenomena. For example, the creation of mountain ranges, earthquakes, volcanic activity, and the formation of ocean basins.</li>
                <p><h3>Earthquakes and Volcanoes:</h3></p>
                <li>Earthquakes often occur at plate boundaries due to the stress caused by the movement of plates.</li>
                <li>Volcanoes are often found at convergent boundaries where one plate is forced beneath another (subduction), and molten rock (magma) from the mantle can rise to the surface.</li>

                <p>Understanding tectonic plates is crucial for understanding the dynamic nature of the Earth's surface and the geological processes that shape our planet over millions of years. The theory of plate tectonics provides a comprehensive framework for explaining the distribution of earthquakes, volcanoes, and mountain ranges across the globe.</p>
